## Repository Structure and Reproducibility

-   `data/` contains de-identified data from the study and a data dictionary
-   `R/` contains functions used in this analysis. 
-   `reports/` contains literate code foor  R Markdown reports generated in the analysis
-   `outputs/` contains compiled reports and figures.
-   This project uses the [{targets}](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/) 
    framework to organize build steps for analysis pipeline.  The steps are
    defined in the `_targets.R` file and the workflow can be executed by running
    `run.R` or `run.sh`. This diagram summarizes the pipeline. steps

)
```
</details>


-   This project requires R 4.2.0. This project us the [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) framework to 
    record R package dependencies and versions. Packages used are recorded in 
    `renv.lock` and code used to manage dependencies is in `renv/` and other files
    in the root project directory.
