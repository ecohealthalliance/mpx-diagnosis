## Repository Structure and Reproducibility

-   `data/datbase_MPX_final_948_deidentified.xls` contains data from the study
    and a data dictionary describing all variables. Data are de-indentified;
    variables collected but removed to anonymize data are described in the
    data dictionary
    
    ***Note that because the analysis uses identifiable data, the full pipeline
    cannot be run with the posted data. Partial data, not including unique
    combinations of variables that would be identifiable, is available upon 
    request.***
    
-   `R/` contains functions used in this analysis. 
-   `reports/` contains literate code for  R Markdown reports generated in the analysis
-   `outputs/` contains compiled reports and figures.
-   This project uses the [{targets}](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/) 
    framework to organize build steps for analysis pipeline.  The steps are
    defined in the `_targets.R` file and the workflow can be executed by running
    `run.R` via `source("run.R")` in your R terminal or `Rscript run.R` in 
    your system shell.  The schematic figure below summarizes the steps. (It uses
    `mermaid.js` syntax and should display as a graph on GitHub.  It can also
    we viewed by pasting the code into <https://mermaid.live>.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(
  "```mermaid",
  targets::tar_mermaid(targets_only = TRUE),
  "```",
  sep = "\n"
)
```

-   This project requires R 4.2.0. This poject uses the [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) framework to 
    record R package dependencies and versions. Packages used are recorded in 
    `renv.lock` and code used to manage dependencies is in `renv/` and other files
    in the root project directory.  On starting an R session in the working directory, run `renv::restore()`
    to install R package dependencies.
    -   The package also requires [`cmdstan`](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) 
        to be installed. (Version 2.29.2 was used). If not already installed, run `cmdstanr::install_cmdstan(version = "2.29.2")`
        after `renv::restore()`
